While we were growing up, my mother repeated a mantra to us: “everything in moderation!”

The idea being, of course, that often, a particular thing is not harmful in and of itself, but it’s the excess, or the lack of “moderation” that can be the problem.

As kids, we often tried to use this to our advantage, to make a case for a certain little treat or indulgence. Sometimes it worked its magic, and we'd succeed:

_“Well I suppose…”_ Her response would go... _“Everything in moderation!”_

But then one day, having negotiated such triumphs as “ice-cream every second night”, I dreamed up the boldest way yet to put this principle to the test: What about... “pizza in moderation”, “fried chicken in moderation”, “burgers in moderation”, “french fries in moderation”, and (... the best one) _“chocolate-for-dinner”_ ... (_in-moderation_ !!) ???

I could see it, within my grasp: one gloriously-delicious, yet still undeniably _moderation-based_ family food pyramid.

Unsurprisingly, mum wasn’t prepared to sanction such a scientific experiment. But still I wasn’t given a satisfying answer as to why my proposition was _truly_ incompatible with her "Moderation maxim".

As I grew older, I began to get less interested in junk food "loopholes", and more interested in other things, including the mental “loop-holes” that us humans can sometimes get stuck in. I may have always had a certain predilection for forming some of these loops myself, but I also noticed them in others, with their sometimes-very-real consequences - whether related to a behaviour, a substance, or even just a pattern of thinking.

Sometimes, these loops can look a little like this:

You'll notice a part of the loop that I call the "Impulse". The Impulse is that moment when the old brain pathways fire up in response to the familiar _trigger_, and your brain is just raring to dive into that old familiar _action_ or pattern of thought - regardless of the consequences.

You may identify with these “loop” patterns. You may also know many people who have been affected by them in different ways. When I observed these patterns in myself, they would generally start innocently enough, but could easily cascade into something more difficult to manage. For me, one interesting example was online speed-chess. I would start playing games to relax, and then before I knew it, my brain was reenforcing a process whereby as soon as one game finished, I _started playing the next game_.

Pop quiz: _what's the limit for how many games of speed chess a human can play in one session?_

Answer: **there is no limit.**

I have no doubt that chess can remain a harmless or even positive and enriching pastime for many, but for me, the infinite possibilities - combined with the rapid-fire succession of novel moves - lead to a neurochemical “perfect storm” of dopamine, adrenaline, cortisol and friends, that was capable of shifting my brain out of “positive” territory and squarely into “unhelpful” land.

As I grew older, I tried leaning on the maxim of “moderation” in the hope that it would “guard” me from these sorts of excesses and their consequences:

- _“Your policy should be: just a few games, here and there...”_
- _“Make sure you limit your playing to 1 hour today, so you have time for other important things. Given that you’ve exceeded that limit now, 3 hours should **definitely** be the limit for today!”_
- _“And above all, never forget: Everything in moderation!”_

## Alignment

In the end, my real progress began when I realised that I needed more than what Mother Moderation could offer me. And that's when I began to form my own principles of _Alignment_, which went on to form the foundation of the [Impulse App](https://impulse.training).

So, what is this concept of Alignment? I like to picture it as a set of rails, like the ones that a train can run on.

Firstly, I needed to recognise the things that were not serving my goals and my happiness, and then make a pledge to simply remove them from my life. I call this my list of _"Guidelines"_, and I think of it as the rail to the _left_.

Secondly, I needed to be prepared for those _Impulse_ moments in which my old patterns of thinking are triggered, and my brain just _really wants_ to go down that old, familiar path. I needed a list of _"Tactics"_ for these moments, and I think of it as the rail to the _right_.

Finally, I needed to identify, out of all the possibilities that lie between these two "guiding" rails, what things are especially positive for me? What things genuinely lift me up, boost my defences, and improve my life and maybe even the lives of those around me? I call this third list my _"Boosters"_, and I think of it as the special "[power-rail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_rail)" running next to the others - the one that can super-charge the train running above.

So let's explore these three concepts in a bit more detail.

## Guidelines

When you identify a list of things that are unhelpful for you and your goals, and make a pledge to _completely avoid them_, you have yourself a set of _"Guidelines"_.

The need for solid Guidlines is predicated on an idea: that some things in life are simply _not helpful_ for us, in any amount. But sometimes, those things stay in our lives anyway, wreaking havoc or perhaps just slightly pulling us down, but possibly going unnoticed or unchallenged for years. Even though we often think that _freedom_ is what we should want, actually, it can be the right kinds of contraints - formulated out of self love and self-belief - that can be liberating in ways that _moderation_ cannot.

Exactly what goes into this list will vary from person to person, and I think some degree of "exploration" will always be necessary as you find your path. For some of my friends in Berlin, this list includes alcohol, where, "one drink is too many, and a thousand is never enough".

After listing the "first" things that come to mind, it's also helpful to identify some of the other things that you do, the places that you go, or the thoughts that you think, that can act as "triggers" for these activities or thought patterns. I encourage you to write those triggers down, too, and aim to completely avoid them as well, in our pursuit of Alignment.

For me, my _"Guidelines list"_ of things to avoid includes:

- _Chess_
- _googling random thoughts_, and
- _mindless Youtube browsing_.

Your turn, to ask yourself:

**Are there behaviours or thought patterns in my life that are limiting my happiness? What about their "trigger" behaviours? Can I acknowledge right now that I don’t want those things in my life, and pledge to do my best to avoid them?**

List as many as you like.

## Tactics

If you got through that exercise, congratulations! But sometimes, simply knowing what you "should" avoid is the easy part. Sometimes, the real challenge is in actually sticking to our guidelines after we've defined them. That old familiar "Impulse" moment will come around again and again, when your brain's old "loop" wiring is triggered, and it just _can't wait_ to dive into that old familiar action or thought pattern. Some people think about two versions of themselves: a "higher" self that has perspective and self-control, and a second version, that seems to act automatically some times, and keeps us feeling stuck in our loops.

If you can relate to any of this, the good news is: you're not alone! Something about these experiences is fundamentally _human_ in nature, and so the great thing is, we can all combine forces to share the _"Tactics"_ that we can deploy to break out of our loops in these critical moments, and get back to our "higher" or more "real" selves.

Tactics include anything we can do to regain perspective, motivation, lightness, and ease in these moments. Sometimes, all it takes is a creative little challenge, reflection, or mind-exercise, to "break out" of the loop and get back on track. Sometimes it helps to be reminded of the consequences of different courses of action (and perhaps write those down!) It can help to identify triggers that might have affected you, or take a moment to "check-in" on your emotional state, and perhaps do something positive to take care of yourself if you're feeling low. You might like to try breathing exercises, math problems, or meditation!

It's important to keep in mind, though, that tactics won't always work, especially as you're getting started. But that's ok. The important thing is that you get prepared, you start trying your tactics in action, and you constantly test and refine them as you go.

For me, my _"Tactics list"_ of things to lean on in Impulse moments currently includes:

- _the ["4/7/8 breathing technique"](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/324417)_
- _quickly drinking two glasses of water_, and
- _going for a walk outside_.

Your turn, to ask yourself:

**What little tricks, distractions, reflections or exercises can I use during my future Impulse moments, to regain perspective, motivation, lightness and ease, and get back on track? Which will I reach for first, the next time I have an Impulse?**

Try to list at least 3!

## Boosters

Now for the fun part: between those guiding of _Guidelines_ and _Tactics_ rails is a third one, and in our train metaphor, it's the _"power-rail"_... you know, the little one that runs alongside the two guiding rails, the one that's electrified with super high voltage?

This rail is made up of your _Boosters_ - all the little things that you can do during your day, to boost your defences, power up your positive energy, and also just _enjoy!_

Within the whole spectrum of choices, activities, and patterns of thinking that ultimately makes up _your life!_, everyone can find those activites that they truly love doing, but that are also genuinely positive and beneficial for them, and those around them.

For me, my _"Boosters List"_ of things to do at any point during the day includes:

- _stretching for at least 10 minutes_
- _calling a friend_
- _reading a book_, and
- _lying down and doing **absolutely nothing!**_ (that's right, no phone!)

Your turn, to ask yourself:
**What activities do I really enjoy doing, but are also truly positive and beneficial for me? Can I try to incorporate more of them into my routine?**

Try to list at least 3, if you can.

## Wrapping up

![image](/chess.png)

Throughout history, many people have formed their own concepts of "Alignment". In sharing mine with you, I hope to keep the important conversation going!

I’ll leave you with a quote from Einstein on chess:

**Chess grips its exponent, shackling the mind and brain so that the inner freedom and independence of even the strongest character cannot remain unaffected.**

What belongs in _your_ list of _Guidelines_ will be different to someone else's. Not all of my _Tactics_ will necessarily work for _you_. And your best _Boosters_ will be the ones that are uniquely capable of energising and strengthening _you_.

Maybe after reading this article you'll now have three short lists that you can review each morning. Or maybe, you will have subscribed to be one of the first to use the [Impulse App](https://impulse.training).

In any case, it's my hope that by taking a while to define your own sets of Alignment rails: your “guidelines”, "tactics", and “boosters”, you might find yourself suddenly tracking a whole lot faster in the direction that you want to go... and enjoying the smoother, safer, supercharged ride.
