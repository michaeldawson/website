My name's Michael - I'm from Australia, but for the last 4 years I've been living in Berlin. I'm off to San Francisco real soon (for work), arriving January 6... I'm looking for a supportive and creative community to become a part of :)

I work as the lead engineer for a sustainable fashion startup called AirRobe. We're growing super fast and so my work is sending me to California to help grow the company there... which I'm really excited about (up until now, I've still never been to the states)

I'm also really passionate about humans in general, and how we can help each other live happier, more connected and fulfilling lives (excuse the corniness haha). Right now I'm working on an app + wearable device to help people overcome addictions and unhelpful thought patterns... It's called [Impulse](https://impulse.training), and I'd love to get your thoughts on it sometime ðŸ¤“

I'm happiest when I live as part of a community - in Berlin I lived most of the time in a 10-person share flat (that's us in the picture above). I work quite a lot so can keep to myself a lot of the time, but I also love spending time chilling / cooking / kicking back together as part of a community.

I'd love to hear more about Club190 and what's important for you in your next roommate. Maybe we could be a good fit ðŸ™Œ
