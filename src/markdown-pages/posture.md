# Posture

Modern humans have existed for millenia, but it's only been in the last few hundred years or so that a number of creature-comforts have become commonplace around us, like the chair, desk, bed, pillow and bed as we know them today. These innovations have transformed our lives in unprecedented ways, but the impact that they've had on our daily routines, and in turn, posture, has little by way of precedent through human history. That is to say, things have changed a lot in the human environment in what is an incredibly brief timescale by evolutionary standards.
