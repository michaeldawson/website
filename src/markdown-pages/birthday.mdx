Here’s the thing: I’m working on an app and wearable device for people who struggle with addictions, and some other “unhelpful thought patterns. The project is called "Impulse". I’m talking about chemical addictions (nicotine, alcohol, and more), but also behavioural ones (gaming, gambling, but yes, also you, internet addicts!), as well as some OCD-related issues (including rumination on negative thoughts, some kinds of eating disorders, impulse-control disorders, and the list goes on).

Many of these issues share similar “Loop-Hole” patterns that can be hard to break out of - like the picture! I call it a Loop-Hole, because it can look like a Loop, but feel like a Hole (...do you like it? Or too corny?)

So I’m really interested in these issues when they’re clinically-diagnosed, but also when we just observe them in ourselves but they remain "manageable"... perhaps still pulling us down over time. I think some people end up much more affected by them than others, but in some ways, there's something about these experiences that is fundamentally _human_ in nature, and shared by a lot of us.
By the way, I will say up-front - I am not a psychologist! But, I’m working with a couple on the project, but am still trying to collect as much information as I can myself 😄

For me personally, I’ve always found myself getting “sucked in” to things like YouTube and even online chess (don’t laugh!).
So, with the Impulse project, there’s a wearable device that is basically just a bluetooth button on a pendant chain. You wear it around your neck, and press the button whenever you’re in an “Impulse” moment - when the cravings or unhelpful thoughts hit. Then you get a notification prompt to deploy your pre-prepared “tactics” in the app - tools and tricks to help break out of the cycle in that moment. Afterwards, the app helps to facilitate a “debrief”, to help you understand the moment, and mark it down as a “win” or a “learn”. What do you think?

The question of what “tactics” can be most effective in these moments is a really interesting one. First up, it’s worth noting that Impulse doesn’t “provide” therapies per-se, but it's a platform in which people can opt-into “well-known” ones, create their own, as well as share what’s working with others. I'm also looking at getting structured programs into the app for users to opt-into, but that's another topic.
But anyway, some examples of "tactics" include CBT techniques like recording your thoughts at the time, breathing techniques, identifying triggers or checking-in on emotions, distractions and physical challenges (e.g. get up and down the nearest flight of stairs), reviewing consequences or progress, as well as "booster" tactics to take care of yourself in the moment (stretching / calling a friend / going for a walk, etc).

Right now I’m in exploration-mode - researching, working with some experts, and also (hopefully!) crowd-sourcing and curating tactics and strategies. That's where YOU come into it... if you’re willing to play-along 🎲

So this is what I’m asking:

- Can you personally relate to these “Loop-Holes” in your life? If so, what tools / strategies / resources have helped, either in the "Impulse" moment or more generally? What didn’t help so much? I don't need personal details, but anything you'd be happy to share, I would love to hear!

- Do you have special knowledge in this area, or know someone who does that you think might be willing to share? I would really appreciate hearing from you.

- Do you have other advice or warnings for the path ahead for Impulse and feel like sharing? It would mean a lot to me 😙

So here's my request: If that’s you, with any of the above, would you jump on a 15-20 minute call with me (or meet me for a coffee or lemonade if you’re in Berlin!) to share your thoughts and experiences, either today (right now?), tomorrow, or next Sunday?

It would be seriously the best birthday present you could ever give me, and I would love so much to learn with/from you! If not, I would also appreciate any thoughts over a message, or any way you'd be comfortable in sharing. Hit me up 🤗

So, seriously, I'm not just looking for one kind of input only - if you can relate to any of this at all, I would love to hear from you.
Note: if you're curious and want to hear some other of my thoughts on this topic, I first wrote this little article a while ago, where I share a few more ideas: https://michaeldawson.com.au/alignment

Lastly, if you just want to follow along with the project, you can leave your email at https://impulse.training, and I'll keep you in the Loop. Or... out of it... or something 😉

Love you all!!!
