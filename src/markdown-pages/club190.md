Hi Club 190 community,

My name's Michael. I'm an Australian, for the last 4 years I've been living in Berlin, but I'm off to San Francisco in the new year :)

I work as the lead engineer for a sustainable fashion startup called AirRobe. We're growing super fast and so my work is sending me to California, which I'm really excited about (up until now, I've still never been to the states!)

I'm also auper passionate about people, and I'm working on an app and wearable device to help people overcome addictions and unhelpful thought patterns (negative self-talk, anger issues, etc). It's called [Impulse](https://impulse.training), and I'd love to get your thoughts some time.

I'm happiest when I live as part of a community - in Berlin I lived most of the time in a 10-person share flat (that's us in the picture above) I work quite a lot so can keep to myself a lot of the time, but I also love spending time together as part of a supportive and inclusive community.

I'd love to hear more about your community and what's important for you in your next roommate. Maybe we could be a good fit :)
