## The World as Will and Representation

Schopenhauer perceived the world as Will — a blind, striving force at the core of reality, and Representation — the forms through which this force appears to us as the things we see and feel. In his view, the Will was not only the root of existence, but also the life-giving energy that compels every being to persist. He saw it as the drive behind all existence, ensuring that each thing not only lives, but keeps on living.

Nietzsche, born some 56 years after Schopenhauer, was deeply influenced by these ideas, but fundamentally challenged them. According to Nietzsche:

> “He certainly did not hit the truth who shot at it the formula: ‘Will to existence’: that will - does not exist! For what is not, cannot will; that, however, which is in existence - how could it still strive for existence!”

For Nietzsche, if something already exists, then positing a “Will to Existence” as a fundamental drive is tautological and misses a deeper, more dynamic principle at work.

## The "Will to Truth"

Nietzsche also identified another key drive in human beings—a “Will to Truth.” He saw the learned, “the wisest ones,” as driven by a desire to make reality fully thinkable and manageable. In his words:

> “'Will to Truth', do ye call it, ye wisest ones, that which impels you and makes you ardent? Will for the thinkableness of all being, thus do I call your will! All being would ye MAKE thinkable: for ye doubt with good reason whether it be already thinkable. But it shall accommodate and bend itself to you! So wills your will.”

The pursuit of truth here is not a neutral quest; it’s an effort to bring reality under conceptual control. Nietzsche saw this underlying motive, a force shaping even the concepts of good and evil, as emerging from a more fundamental drive:

> “That is your entire will, ye wisest ones, as a Will to Power; and even when ye speak of good and evil, and of estimates of value. Ye would still create a world before which ye can bow the knee: such is your ultimate hope and ecstasy.”

## The Will to Power

For Nietzsche, this “creation of a world before which one could kneel” was the ultimate expression of a more basic principle: the Will to Power. All forms of life—indeed all existence—were, in his view, expressions of this fundamental Will. He famously wrote:

> “And this secret spake Life herself unto me. ‘Behold,’ she said, ‘I am that WHICH MUST EVER OVERCOME ITSELF. To be sure, ye call it will to procreation, or impulse towards a goal, towards the higher, remoter, more manifold: but all that is one and the same secret. Rather would I succumb than disown this one thing; and verily, where there is succumbing and leaf-falling, lo, there doth Life sacrifice itself - for power!”

Here, the Will to Power is understood as the driving force of life’s continual self-overcoming, its ceaseless drive to go beyond its current state. Think of a seedling pushing through dry, cracked earth to find the sun. What compels it to push past rocks and obstacles? For Nietzsche, it is a manifestation of the Will to Power - the seedling’s innate striving to overcome and become more than it currently is.

## A Twisted History

To me, there's a beauty in this vision of the Will to Power — yet Nietzsche’s ideas have been distorted over the years. Although Nietzsche despised anti-Semitic and nationalist currents in late 19th-century Germany, his sister Elisabeth took a different view. After Nietzsche’s mental collapse in 1889 and his subsequent death, Elisabeth temporarily took control of his legacy.

Through the Nietzsche Archive she founded in 1894, Elisabeth manipulated her brother’s unpublished writings, selectively editing and presenting them to further her own nationalist and anti-Semitic agenda. She even became an ardent supporter of nationalist movements, and in the 1930s, associated herself with the Nazi regime, meeting Adolf Hitler and promoting an oppressive interpretation of Nietzsche’s philosophy.

The Nazis seized on concepts like the Will to Power to bolster their ideology of Aryan supremacy and militarism. Only later, through careful scholarly re-examination, did Nietzsche’s reputation begin to recover. Scholars highlighted his critiques of nationalism, authoritarianism, and mass conformity, restoring an understanding of Nietzsche as an existentialist thinker who championed individual self-overcoming rather than domination.

## Lost (?) in Translation

The nuance of Nietzsche’s original German phrase, “Wille zur Macht,” is often lost in translation. While “power” in English commonly suggests political or interpersonal dominance, “Macht” in Nietzsche’s usage is more subtle - implying a creative force, a striving beyond oneself, a principle of continual becoming rather than static control.

This Will to Power is not merely about having power over others, but about life’s fundamental push toward growth, self-expression, and overcoming resistance. It’s a metaphysical principle, the throbbing heart of life’s perpetual emergence.

## The Problem?

If we witness a world entrenched with its systems and its struggles, and with powerful people pushing powerful agendas, it’s easy to conclude that power-seeking is “the root of all problems.” Yet life’s truths often unfold in dichotomies. Consider the lion and zebra locked in a life-and-death struggle. Do we mourn the zebra’s plight or the emaciated lion’s suffering hunger? Nietzsche would say both are manifestations of the same Will—life overcoming itself, striving, playing out on the world’s grand stage beyond moral labels of “good” or “evil.”

## Dynamics and Interconnectedness

“Macht” suggests a dynamic process—life as becoming, not just possessing. In this sense, it aligns with other philosophies that see reality as interplay. Daoism’s Tao, for instance, flows through all things, balancing opposites into harmonized wholes. Nature itself brims with symbiotic relationships: fungi networking nutrients to tree roots, bees pollinating flowers, and countless other interdependencies.

## From Will to Power to Will to Thrive

Perhaps we can take Nietzsche’s insight and adapt it for our modern language and modern world. He overcame Schopenhauer’s Will to Existence with his Will to Power. Could we now take Nietzsche’s Will to Power and overcome it with a _Will to Thrive?_

The language we use to discuss these ideas matters. We must champion a culture that tells people—no matter their race, gender, or background, they were _born to thrive_.

This Will to Thrive pushes seedings through soil, and bursts their petals into radiant bloom, but where the soil space is limited, it creates hanging gardens that pinned to the walls of super-skyscrapers.

It doesn't simply climb over others to dominate, it seeks conditions for widespread flourishing, and smashes limitations of possibility - internal and external.

## Capitalism, Abundance, and Specialization

Nature abounds with symbiotic relationships that enable mutual thriving. But also in human life, specialized economies and collaborative networks sustain a level of thriving unimaginable in isolation.

In the modern human world, capitalism and other large-scale systems are often (rightly) criticized. Many see them as oppressive, yet we must not forget that they’ve also driven immense economic growth, reshaped every aspect of our lives, and massively reduced poverty worldwide. We can acknowledge both the need for improvement and the undeniable expansions of human capability and manifestation.

It's true that as we look to the future, we must consider economic models that can support an epoch of abundance, but instead of a fixed-pie mentality, let's set our aim to be to support every human to thrive. Not by equalizing outcomes, but by fostering conditions in which all can overcome barriers and realize their potential.

Thriving, indeed, is about overcoming: facing obstacles and changing ourselves or our circumstances despite hardship.

## Love as an outwardly-expressed Will to Thrive

Can we even define love as _“wishing thriving for another”_? And if we can, can we [love that which we love, and keep expanding it?](https://open.spotify.com/track/5kdXiiF8MxyLVhRjkVv9jQ?si=5dcc37d41bec4134)?

## Our Call

Our call is to tear down systemic barriers to opportunity. Fight the narrative that teaches people that they are victims of their circumstance. Remind the young, the marginalized, and the world at large that thriving is their birthright. Forge tools to help people overcome limitations that hold them back. In doing so, we amplify not just their own Will to Thrive, but our own.
