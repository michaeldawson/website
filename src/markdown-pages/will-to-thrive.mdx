### Disclaimer

This is [unfinished, scrappy work](https://untested.sonnet.io/Share+your+unfinished%2C+scrappy+work)! I've been wanting to write more these days, and have just recently started using [Enso](https://enso.sonnet.io), a tool that makes it easier to enter a state of flow when writing... by making it harder to edit what you write. If you're keen to write more yourself, I would recommend giving it a go! That said I do plan to come back to this particular topic and try to do more justice to it, because it's actually something deeply important to me, so it definitely deserves more than this cursory first-pass. But a cursory first-pass is better uncursory 0 passes, so for that reason I'm glad to have got something out on proverbial paper, and up here for the googlebots to see.

### Without further ado

Shopenhauer saw the world as Will: a blind, striving force that permeated everything around us. He saw the world as this Will, but also as Representation: the various forms in which the Will manifests itself in the things that we see and experience. To him, this Will was ultimately a Will for Existence - the driving force behind reality, and the sustaining and life-giving force of the universe that allowed every _thing_ to keep existing.

<br />
Nietzsche, being born 56 years after Schopenhauer, was heavily influenced by him,
including his ideas on the Will. But he fundamentally took issue with Schopenhauer's
will, claiming:

> He certainly did not hit the truth who shot at it the formula: “Will to existence”: that will - does not exist! For what is not, cannot will; that, however, which is in existence - how could it still strive for existence!”

He also saw in others a supposed "Will to Truth" - an attempt to subjugate and tame reality:

> “Will to Truth”, do ye call it, ye wisest ones, that which impells you and makes you ardent? Will for the thinkableness of all being, thus do I call your will! All being would ye MAKE thinkable: for ye doubt with good reason whether it be already thinkable. But it shall accommodate and bend itself to you! So wills your will.

While he didn't deny their attempts to bend and tame reality to their concept of Truth, he refused to recognize them, inherently, as a fundamental, driving, "Will to Truth". Instead, he said that the secret of Life was revealed to him, as a fundamental Will to Power.

> “And this secret spake Life herself unto me. “Behold,” she said, “I am that WHICH MUST EVER OVERCOME ITSELF. To be sure, ye call it will to procreation, or impulse towards a goal, towards the higher, remoter, more manifold: but all that is one and the same secret. Rather would I succumb than disown this one thing; and verily, where there is succumbing and leaf-falling, lo, there doth Life sacrifice itself - for power!

To the "wisest" ones, he spoke:

> That is your entire will, ye wisest ones, as a Will to Power; and evern when ye speak of good and evil, and of estimates of value. Ye would still create a world before which ye can bow the knee: such is your ultimate hope and ecstasy.

The Will to Truth, seen as an effort to subjugate and tame the world, was simply a thinly veiled Will to Power - the same Will to Power that underlies all expressions, forms and efforts of Life: the “unexhausted, procreating life-will”.

<br />
To me, when I think of Nietzsche’s Will to Power, I think of the striving of the
seedling as it pushes through dry and cracked earth to find the sun.
<br />
Where Nietzsche saw beneath the fabric of Life itself, into the essence of Reality,
his words have been taken and twisted by some to further their own ends. Nietzsche
specifically hated anti-semitic and nationalist ideas that were gaining traction
in his late 19th century Germany, but the same can’t be said for his sister Elisabeth,
who in fact held nationalist and anti-semitic beliefs.
<br />
After Nietzsche’s mental collapse in 1889 and later death, Elisabeth founded the
Nietzsche Archive in 1894, and through that institution compiled and edited Nietzsche’s
unpublished writings, which gave her significant power over how his ideas were presented
to the public. She used this power to promote her brother’s philosophy but often
manipulated his ideas to suit her own agenda.
<br />
After Elisabeth and her husband’s failed attempts to create a “pure Aryan” colony
in Paraguay in the late 19th century, she returned to Germany and became an argent
supporter of nationalist causes, aligning herself with the rising Nazi party in the
1930s and even meeting Adoft Hitler, aligning herself and her brother’s legacy with
the Nazi regime.
<br />
The Nazis exploited Nietzsche’s philosophy, particularly concepts like his “will
to power”, to support their ideology of Aryan supremacy and militarism.
<br />
It wasn’t until later scholarship re-evaluated Nietzsche’s writings and intentions
that his reputation began to recover, emphasizing his criticisms of nationalism and
authoritarianism, and allowing his genuine philosophical contributions to become
untangled from the distortions introduced by Elisabeth, highlighting his existentialist,
individualist, and often anti-authoritarian views.
<br />
But when we look around and see the world with its systems and struggles, and powerful
people pushing powerful agendas, aren't we to conclude that this lens of the world
must be somehow "a part of the problem"?
<br />
I suggest that just as Nietzsche saw Schopenhauer’s Will to Existence and overcame
it with his Will to Power, we too must see his Will to Power and overcome it with
a Will to Thrive.
<br />
This "Will to Thrive" also pushes that seedling through the dried and cracked earth
to find the sun, and bursts the petals of the flower open into the sun in unecessarily
radiant glory. While the grasping and clinging vines may pull down on each other
as they reach upward, the sun has limitless energy to impart on all of those that
make to the canopy. Nature is full of symbiotic relationships that empower and unlock
thriving that would be impossible in isolation: from fungi that tap into the networks
of roots of trees to allow for water and mineral transfers, to our own specialized
human economies that support the marvels of modern technology and convenience.
<br />
We live on a planet of abundant resources. We have a mandate to be good stewards
of this earth, but we mustn’t let a fixed pie fallacy constrain our thinking. I like
the metaphor for education when talking about human potential. Imagine this exchange:
<br />
Person: Education outcomes have been climbing higher and higher in Australia, this
is something to celebrate! Critic: It’s actually not fair - education outcomes are
poor in some developing countries - Australia stealing all of the education! This
is something to be ashamed of - not to celebrate.
<br />
When applied to education, this kind of "fixed pie" thinking would be laughable,
right? So why do we tolerate it with economic and human thriving outcomes? The question
is not “how can we equalize outcomes for all humans”, but rather, “how can we support
every human to thrive?”
<br />
So, what does human thriving look like? To me, it can take many forms, and is ultimately
up to the individual, but most fundamentally, to me it looks like _overcoming_. When
we face obstacles and aspects of our life that we want to change, the act of changing
them despite the difficulty: therein lies the thriving!

### TODO:

# The will to thrive is in each of us

# Supporting the will to thrive in others amplifies the will to thrive in yourself

# Systemic barriers that impede Will To Thrive must be torn down

# Our call as humans is to amplify the Will To Thrive, and to celebrate it

### A final thought

Taking this one step further: can we think of love, then, as simply _wishing thriving on another_?

<br />
It’s easy to wish for thriving for those “close to us”, but can we [love that which
we love, and keep expanding it](https://open.spotify.com/track/5kdXiiF8MxyLVhRjkVv9jQ?si=5dcc37d41bec4134)?

<br />
Could we expand this wish for thriving beyong ourselves, our closest relatives and
friends, to include the whole earth?
