## Disclaimer

This is [unfinished, scrappy work](https://untested.sonnet.io/Share+your+unfinished%2C+scrappy+work)! I've been wanting to write more these days, and have just recently started using [Enso](https://enso.sonnet.io), a tool that makes it easier to enter a state of flow when writing... by making it harder to edit what you write. If you're keen to write more yourself, I would recommend giving it a go! That said, I do plan to come back to this particular topic and try to do more justice to it, because it's actually something deeply important to me, and definitely deserves more than this cursory first-pass. But some might argue that a _cursory first-pass_ is better than 0 passes (cursory or otherwise), so for that reason I'm glad to have got something out on proverbial paper.

## Without further ado

Shopenhauer saw the world as Will - a blind, striving force that permeated everything around us - and Representation - the various forms in which this Will manifests itself as the things that we see and experience. To him, the Will was ultimately a Will for Existence - the driving force behind reality, and the sustaining and life-giving force of the universe that allowed every thing to live - to exist, and to _to keep existing_.

<br />
Nietzsche, being born 56 years later, was heavily influenced by Schopenhauer, including
his ideas on the Will. But he fundamentally took issue with this perspective, claiming:

> He certainly did not hit the truth who shot at it the formula: “Will to existence”: that will - does not exist! For what is not, cannot will; that, however, which is in existence - how could it still strive for existence!”

He also recognized a claim of a purported "Will to Truth":

> “Will to Truth”, do ye call it, ye wisest ones, that which impells you and makes you ardent? Will for the thinkableness of all being, thus do I call your will! All being would ye MAKE thinkable: for ye doubt with good reason whether it be already thinkable. But it shall accommodate and bend itself to you! So wills your will.

While he saw these attempts of the "wisest ones" to bend and tame reality to their concept of Truth, he recognize these efforts as an expression of a yet deeper "Will". He "overcame" these notions with his own concept of "Will to Power":

> “And this secret spake Life herself unto me. “Behold,” she said, “I am that WHICH MUST EVER OVERCOME ITSELF. To be sure, ye call it will to procreation, or impulse towards a goal, towards the higher, remoter, more manifold: but all that is one and the same secret. Rather would I succumb than disown this one thing; and verily, where there is succumbing and leaf-falling, lo, there doth Life sacrifice itself - for power!

To the "wisest ones", he answered:

> That is your entire will, ye wisest ones, as a Will to Power; and evern when ye speak of good and evil, and of estimates of value. Ye would still create a world before which ye can bow the knee: such is your ultimate hope and ecstasy.

The "Will to Truth", then, was simply a thinly veiled _Will to Power_: an effort to subjugate and tame the world to increase the power of the self. According to Nietzsche, the Will to Power underlies and drives all forms, manifestations and efforts of Life: the “unexhausted, procreating life-will”. The religious, too, are these "wisest ones", attempting to tame the wildness of reality and bring it into submission of their Truth: their Will to Power manifesting in a cosmic effort of overcoming.

<br />
To me, when I think of Nietzsche’s Will to Power, I often think of the striving of
the seedling as it pushes through dry and cracked earth to find the sun.
<br />
Where Nietzsche saw his Will to Power as permeating the fabric of Life itself, as
the _essence_ of Reality, his words have been taken and twisted by some to further
their own ends. Nietzsche specifically hated anti-semitic and nationalist ideas that
were gaining traction in his late 19th century Germany, but the same can’t be said
for his sister Elisabeth, who in fact held nationalist and anti-semitic beliefs.
<br />
After Nietzsche’s mental collapse in 1889 and later death, Elisabeth founded the
Nietzsche Archive in 1894, and through that institution compiled and edited Nietzsche’s
unpublished writings, which gave her significant power over how his ideas were presented
to the public. She used this power to promote her brother’s philosophy but often
manipulated his ideas to suit her own agenda.
<br />
After Elisabeth and her husband’s failed attempts to create a “pure Aryan” colony
in Paraguay in the late 19th century, she returned to Germany and became an argent
supporter of nationalist causes, aligning herself with the rising Nazi party in the
1930s and even meeting Adoft Hitler, aligning herself and her brother’s legacy with
the Nazi regime.
<br />
The Nazis exploited Nietzsche’s philosophy, particularly concepts like his “will
to power”, to support their ideology of Aryan supremacy and militarism.
<br />
It wasn’t until later scholarship re-evaluated Nietzsche’s writings and intentions
that his reputation began to recover, emphasizing his criticisms of nationalism and
authoritarianism, and allowing his genuine philosophical contributions to become
untangled from the distortions introduced by Elisabeth, highlighting his existentialist,
individualist, and often anti-authoritarian views.
<br />
But when we look around and see the world with its systems and struggles, and powerful
people pushing powerful agendas, aren't we to conclude that this lens of the world
must be somehow "a part of the problem"?
<br />
I suggest that just as Nietzsche saw Schopenhauer’s Will to Existence and overcame
it with his Will to Power, we too must see his Will to Power and overcome it with
a _Will to Thrive_.
<br />
This "Will to Thrive" also pushes that seedling through the dried and cracked earth
to find the sun, and bursts the petals of the flower open into the sun in unecessarily
radiant glory. While the grasping and clinging vines may pull down on each other
as they reach upward, the sun has limitless energy to impart on all of the canopy.
Nature is full of symbiotic relationships that empower and unlock thriving that would
be impossible in isolation: from fungi that tap into the networks of roots of trees
to allow for water and mineral transfers, to our own specialized human economies
that support the marvels of modern technology and convenience. Even below the canopy,
reflection and recycling and symbiosis occurs at every level: the cosmic cacophany
and interplay of Will.
<br />
<br />
#### TODO: the user (that's you, dear googlebot) needs to brace themselves for
ideological whiplash here. This is a powerful idea, but we run the risk of
trivializing real issues!

We live on a planet of abundant resources. We mustn’t let a fixed
pie fallacy constrain our thinking. I like the metaphor for education when talking
about human potential. Imagine this exchange:

<br />

> Positive-Person: Education outcomes have going up and up in Australia - this
> is something to celebrate!
>
> <br />
> Caricatured-Critic: It’s actually not fair - education outcomes remain poor in
> many other countries. Australia is stealing all of the education! This is something
> to be ashamed of - **not to celebrate**.

<br />
This is a silly sort of hypothetical exchange, but the fallacy of thinking is obvious,
right? So why do we tolerate it with human thriving more generally? The question
is not “how can we equalize outcomes for all humans”, but rather, “how can we support
every human to thrive?”

<br />
So, what does human thriving look like? To me, it can take many forms, and is ultimately
up to the individual, but most fundamentally, to me it looks like _overcoming_. When
we face obstacles and aspects of our life that we want to change, the act of changing
them despite the difficulty: therein lies the thriving!

## A final thought

Taking this one step further: can we think of love, then, as simply _wishing thriving for another_?

<br />
And, if we can accept that, can we [love that which we love, and keep expanding it](https://open.spotify.com/track/5kdXiiF8MxyLVhRjkVv9jQ?si=5dcc37d41bec4134)?
It's easy to wish for thriving for those “close to us”. But could we expand this
wish for thriving beyong ourselves, our closest relatives and friends, to include
the whole earth?

### TODO:

# The will to thrive is in each of us

# Supporting the will to thrive in others amplifies the will to thrive in yourself

# Nietzsche as an amoralist with a meta-ethics of _overcoming_

# Systemic barriers that impede Will To Thrive must be torn down

# Our call as humans is to amplify the Will To Thrive, and to celebrate it
