A few years ago, I explored the differences between working from a "List" and a "Schedule". When you work from a list, your work is unstructured, free-form, and you have no real-sense of when you will actually get any particular task done (sound familiar?).

To some extent this reflects the realities of getting things done in the real world - you may have several things to do, you may have a sense of their relative priorities, and you may not know how long each item will take. So we write them down on paper, we start at the top, and we work down.

But I think there's a better way. When you work from a _schedule_, you first estimate each task, then assign it to one or more specific time slots in your calendar. You're likely to have "events" in your calendar already, which each have a start and end time. In the space "around" these events, you can work on your tasks. When you have a schedule in front of you, you have a clear sense of what to work on, and when. You can imagine your day mapped out - and have a clearer sense of exactly _how_ to achieve your goals for the day. You also have a better sense of when something is taking longer than expected, and this can provide insights into the task itself or your expectations of it, your estimating process and also your working style.

ActionPact is a proposed tool to manage this "mapping" from "List" to "Schedule". You could import a "list" of tasks from your existing project management software (Trello, Asana, Pivotal Tracker, etc) and provide individual time estimates if they don't exist. Then, ActionPact would be able to distribute these tasks into your calendar automatically, "filling up" your day with tasks allocated into free slots. With a Google-calendar integration and some visual, drag-and-drop tools, it would help you to start "thinking in schedules" rather than "thinking in lists".

You could choose how you like to work - perhaps you can use the pomodoro technique, where your day is broken up into 30 minute slots, each of 25 minutes work and a 5 minute rest / review period? Or, you might like to go deeper, and work in 1 or 2 hour "slots". Maybe you could test both and see what works best.

Then, imagine getting feedback that you aren't tracking to get everything done on time, based on your schedule. It could be useful, right?

There are _some_ tools that exist that do a decent job of this list-schedule task mapping, in my opinion. One of my favourites is https://ticktick.com. But, I haven't yet found a tool that really nails it, so I wanted to build my own.

In any case, a few years ago my native app development skills weren't really up-to-scratch, and the project ran out of steam.

Here's [a link](https://actionpactapp.com) to a video and some more explanations, but the app isn't taking new registrations right now.

But... what do you think? Do you want ActionPact so badly that you'd sell the shirt on your back to have it? Have you found a tool that solves this problem well? I would love to hear about it!

I would love to come back to this "problem space" in a few years, and I would love to hear your input in the meantime. [Drop me a line!](mailto:hi@michaeldawson.com.au)
