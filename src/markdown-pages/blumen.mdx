Hi Blumen team! I heard that you are growing fast and have some currently open roles for senior software engineers, and thought I'd reach out.

<br />I am a full-stack web, mobile, and data engineer with over 12 years of
experience working with technologies such as Ruby on Rails,
JavaScript/TypeScript, React, React Native (Expo), Elasticsearch, AWS/Firebase,
SQL, Snowflake, and DBT, and recently, OpenAI APIs and agentic frameworks such
as llamaindex. I'm currently open to contract work opportunities and would love
to learn more about your projects, challenges, and how I might be able to
contribute to your team.

<br />
I'm the founder of [impulse](https://impulse.training), and we're helping people
overcome addictions and other unwanted patterns of thinking and behavior. In my most
recent role, I led the engineering team at an Australian consumer marketplace and
data startup, where I contributed to the companyâ€™s growth from a $0.6M to a $34M
valuation in just two years. I am passionate about building high-performing teams
and processes, such as mob programming, but I also love grinding away at tough technical
problems.
<br />

I am seeking a 3-6 month contract where I can bring a ton of value to a
growing team. If my experience aligns with your needs, I would be really happy
to discuss how I can support your team. I am open to working at a discounted
rate and would be happy to volunteer some time initially to ensure a good fit
between us.

<br />
Cheers!
<br />
~M
