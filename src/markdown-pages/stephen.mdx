      I’ve struggled with addiction in a few different forms. I've also lost
      loved ones to drug and alcohol addiction.

  <em>Impulse</em> is a hardware and software intervention for people struggling
  with these issues. I believe that it can be highly effective, and early test
  data supports that belief.

  The software app allows for building a modular "gameplan" of tactics to deploy
  in the moment. The wearable button is a physical prompt to bring you back to
  your gameplan when it matters most.

    Impulse is an example of a
    [Just-In-Time-Adaptive-Intervention](https://d3c.isr.umich.edu/intervention-designs/just-in-time-adaptive-interventions/).
    JITAIs are a promising area of development for treatment of addiction and
    related issues. The hardware component is currently off-the-shelf, running
    proprietary firmware. The app is cross-platform, built on React Native and
    Google Firebase.

  I am ready to relentlessly drive this project, but I need to grow the team.
  I'm looking for a UX lead, and psychologist supervisor for the pilot program.
  I'm open to finding a world-class co-founder. I'm too early for most funds
  right now, but with your support we can obtain some real momentum and data
  from a pilot program, and then raise subsequent funding. I would like to aim
  for participation in YC or a similar incubator program in 6 months.
