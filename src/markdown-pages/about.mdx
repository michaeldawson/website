Hi! I'm a software developer, and the CEO and founder of [impulse](https://impulse.training).

I work with web, mobile and data engineering technologies:

- React Native
- Typescript / Javascript
- React / Gatsby / Next.js
- Web components / Lit
- Ruby / Rails
- Data Engineering (SQL, DBT)
- Serverless / Firebase
- Elasticsearch
- Bluetooth devices
- After Effects animations

I'm also interested in the startup process, in particular, how to reduce the cost and time that it takes to learn on the way to building something great. I recommend [Lean Stack](https://leanstack.com/) for those interested in the science of successful startups.

I'm a member of the Collaborative VC [Hitchhiker](https://hitchhiker.vc) - we invest in amazing teams and game-changing ventures. I'm always interested in hearing about interesting projects that people are working on. Feel free to [drop me a line!](mailto:hi@michaeldawson.com.au)
