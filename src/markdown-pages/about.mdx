Hi! I'm a software developer, and I work with web, mobile and data engineering technologies. I also enjoy making animation videos with Adobe After Effects. My main software focus areas are:<br />

- Typescript / Javascript
- React Native
- React / Gatsby / Next.js
- Ruby / Rails
- Data Engineering (SQL, DBT)
- Serverless / Firebase
- Elasticsearch

I'm also interested in the startup process, in particular, how to reduce the cost and time that it takes to learn on the way to building something great. I recommend [Lean Stack](https://leanstack.com/) for those interested in the science of successful startups.

I'm a member of the Collaborative VC [Hitchhiker](https://hitchhiker.vc) - we invest in amazing teams and game-changing ventures. I'm always interested in hearing about interesting projects that people are working on. Feel free to [drop me a line!](mailto:hi@michaeldawson.com.au)
