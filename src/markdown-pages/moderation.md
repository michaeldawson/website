While we were growing up, my mother repeated a mantra to us: “everything in moderation!”

The idea being, of course, that often, a particular thing is not harmful in and of itself, but it’s the excess, or the lack of “moderation” that can be the problem.

As kids, we tried to use this to our advantage, often to make a case for a certain little treat or indulgence. Sometimes it worked its magic, and we'd succeed:

_“Well I suppose…” Her response would go. “Everything in moderation!”_

But then one day, having negotiated such triumphs as “ice-cream every second night”, I dreamed up the boldest way yet to put this principle to the test: What about... “pizza in moderation”, “fried chicken in moderation”, “burgers in moderation”, “french fries in moderation”, and (... the best one) _“chocolate-for-dinner”_ ... (_in-moderation_ !!) ???

I could see it, within my grasp: one gloriously-delicious, yet still undeniably _moderation-based_ family food pyramid.

Unsurprisingly, mum wasn’t prepared to sanction such a scientific experiment. But still I wasn’t given a satisfying answer as to why my proposition was _truly_ incompatible with her maxim.

As I grew older, I began to get more and more interested in the mental “loops” that us humans can sometimes get stuck in - whether related to a behaviour, a substance, or even just a pattern of thinking. I may have always had a certain predilection for forming some of these loops, but I also noticed them in others, with their sometimes-very-real consequences.

For some addictions, that loop can look a bit like this:

What I call the "Impulse" part of the loop, others call the "Craving". It's that moment when the old brain pathways fire up in response to the trigger, and your brain is just _raring_ to see through the old familiar action or pattern of thought - whatever the consequences might be.

You may identify with this “loop” pattern. You may also know many people who have been affected by these sorts of loops in different ways.

When I observed these patterns in myself, they would generally start innocently enough, but could easily cascade into something more difficult to manage. For me, one interesting example was online speed-chess. I would start playing games to relax, and then before I knew it, my brain was reenforcing a process whereby _as soon as one game finished, I started playing the next game_.

Question: _what's the limit for how many games of speed chess a human can play in one session?_

Answer: **there is no limit.**

I have no doubt that chess can remain a harmless, positive pastime for many people. For me, though, the infinite possibilities, combined with the rapid-fire succession of novel moves, lead to a neurochemical “perfect storm” of dopamine, adrenaline, cortisol and friends, that was capable of shifting my brain out of “positive” territory and squarely into the “unhelpful”.

As I grew older, I tried leaning on the maxim of “moderation” in the hope that it would “guard” me from excesses and their consequences.

- _“Your policy should be: just a few games, here and there...”_
- _“Make sure you limit your playing to 1 hour today, so you have time for other important things.”_
- _“Given that you’ve exceeded that 1 hour limit now, 2 hours should **definitely** be the limit for today!”_
- _“And above all, never forget: Everything in moderation!”_

## Alignment

But in the end, my real progress began when I realised that I needed something else beyond the soothing promises of Moderation. And that's when I developed my own principles of _Alignment_, which went on to form the basis of the [Impulse App](https://impulse.training).

So, what is Alignment? I like to picture it as a set of rails, like the ones that a train can run on.

Firstly, I needed to recognise the things that simply were not serving my goals and my happinessand then make a clear pledge to remove them from my life. I call this list of things my _"Guidelines"_, and I think of them as the "rail" to the left.

Secondly, I needed to be prepared for those Impulse moments in which my old patterns of thinking are triggered, and my brain just _really wants_ to go down that old, familiar path, despite the consequences. I needed a list of _"Tactics"_ for these moments, and I think of them as the "rail" to the right.

Finally, I needed to out of all the possibilities that can lie between those rails, what things are especially positive for me - things that genuinely lift me up, boost my defences and increase my quality of life? I call this third list my _"Boosters"_, and I think of it as the special power-rail running in between the other two rails, that supercharges the train running above.

## Guidelines

When you identify a list of things that are unhelpful for you and your goals, and make a pledge to _completely avoid them_, you have yourself a set of _"Guidelines"_.

This definition is predicated on an idea: that some things in life are simply _not helpful_ for us. Even though we often think that _freedom_ is what we want, the right kinds of contraints - formulated out of self love and self-belief - can be liberating in ways that freedom, or the even the assurances of "moderation", can never be.

Exactly what goes into this list will vary from person to person, and I think some degree of exploration will always be necessary. For some of my friends in Berlin, this list includes alcohol, where, "one drink is too many and a thousand is never enough".

After listing the "main things" that come to mind, it's also helpful to identify some of the other things that you do, the places that you go, or the thoughts that you think that can act as "triggers" for the items on the list that you just wrote down. Write those things down, too, and treat them the same way you do as the rest of the list. We're going to aim to completely avoid them as well, in the pursuit of Alignment, happiness, and fulfilment.

For me, my _"Guidelines list"_ of things to avoid includes:

- _Chess_
- _googling random thoughts_, and
- _mindless Youtube browsing_.

Your turn, to ask yourself:

**Are there behaviours or thought patterns in my life that are limiting my happiness? What about their "trigger" behaviours? Can I acknowledge right now that I don’t want those things in my life, and pledge to do my best to avoid them?**

List as many of these as you like.

## Tactics

If you got through that exercise, congratulations! But sometimes, simply knowing what you "should" avoid is the easy part. Sometimes, the real challenge is in actually sticking to our guidelines after we've defined them. That old familiar "Impulse" moment will come around again, when your brain's old wiring is triggered, and it just _can't wait_ to get started with the old action or thought pattern. Some people think about two versions of themselves - a "higher" self that has the perspective to do things like write down a personal list of Guidelines, and a second version, that sometimes acts automatically in these "Impulse" moments, doing the thing that we know doesn't help us, keeping us feeling stuck in our loops.

If you can relate to that, the good news is - you're not alone! Something about these expereinces is fundamentally _human_ in nature, and so, the great thing is, we can all combine forces to share the _"Tactics"_ that we can deploy in these moments to break out of our loops, and get back to our "higher" selves.

Tactics include anything we can do in these moments to regain perspective, motivation, lightness, and ease. Sometimes, all it takes is a creative little challenge, reflection, or mind-exercise, to "break out" of the loop and get back on track. Sometimes it helps to be reminded of the consequences of different courses of action (and write them down!). Often, it helps to identify triggers that might have affected you, or take a moment to "check-in" on your emotional state, and do something positive to take care of yourself if you're feeling low. You might like to try breathing exercises, or math problems!

The most important thing is that you get prepared, because - believe me - the Impulse moments will come.

For me, my _"Tactics list"_ of things to lean on in Impulse moments includes:

- _the ["4/7/8 breathing technique"](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/324417)_
- _quickly drinking two glasses of water_, and
- _going for a walk outside_.

Your turn, to ask yourself:

**What little tricks, distractions, reflections or exercises can I use during my future Impulse moments, to regain perspective, motivation, lightness and ease, and get back on track?**

Try to list at least 3!

## Boosters

In the middle, between the two rails of Guidelines and Tactics, is a whole spectrum of choices, activities, and patterns of thinking that ultimately makes up _your life!_ I enjoy thinking about the pure possibility that lies ahead, for all of us.

But between those rails is a third rail, if you know how to tap into it. It's the _"power-rail"_ - you know, the one that runs between the two guiding rails, the one that is electrified with super high voltage. This is the rail that the train can draw on for power while it tracks ahead.

Making up this rail are your "booster" activities - the things that you can use at any point during your day, to boost your defences and also just simply enjoy doing! Your boosters can be anything that you love doing, but that are truly positive and beneficial for you.

For me, my _"Boosters List"_ of things to do at any point during the day includes:

- _stretching for at least 10 minutes_
- _calling a friend_
- _reading a book_, and
- _lying down and doing **absolutely nothing!**_ (that's right, no phone!)

Your turn, to ask yourself:
**What activities do I really enjoy doing, but are also truly positive and beneficial for me? Can I try to incorporate more of them into my routine?**

Try to list at least 3, if you can.

## Wrapping up

Throughout history, humans have often formed their own concepts of alignment: how to live a great life. In sharing mine with you, I hope to keep the important conversation going.

I’ll leave you with a quote from Einstein on chess:

**Chess grips its exponent, shackling the mind and brain so that the inner freedom and independence of even the strongest character cannot remain unaffected.**

Chances are, chess might not belong in your Guidelines as something to avoid completely. What's more, not all of my tactics will necessarily work for you in the same way. And finally, I'm sure that you'll have _your own_ boosters that are uniquely capable of energising and strengthening _you_.

Maybe after reading this article you'll now have three short lists that you can review each morning. Or maybe, you've subscribed now for updates on the [Impulse App](https://impulse.training), so that you'll have some more tools on-hand to help you with these things as you go on your way.

In any case, it's my hope that by laying down your own clear sets of rails: your “guidelines”, your "tactics", and your “boosters”, you might find yourself tracking a whole lot faster in the direction you want to go... and enjoying the smoother, safer, supercharged ride.
