# Moderation is a lie.

## Your _guidelines_ can set you free.

While growing up, my mother repeated a mantra to us kids: “everything in moderation!”

The idea being, of course, that usually a particular thing is not harmful in and of itself, but it’s the excess, or the lack of “moderation” applied to the things that we do, that can be the problem.

As kids, we often tried to use this maxim to make a case for a particular treat or indulgence. Sometimes we’d succeed, with it working its magic in her mind: “Well I suppose…” Her response would go. “Everything in moderation!”

But then one day, having such negotiated such triumphs as “ice-cream every second night”, I dreamed up the boldest way yet to put this principle to the test: What about... “pizza in moderation”, “fried chicken in moderation”, “burgers in moderation”, “french fries in moderation”, and (the best one yet) “chocolate-for-dinner (_in-moderation_!)”?? I could see them all, within my grasp: combined together, to form one gloriously-delicious, yet still undeniably _moderation-based_ family food pyramid.

Unsurprisingly, mum wasn’t prepared to sanction such a scientific experiment. But still I wasn’t given a satisfying answer as to why my proposition was _truly_ incompatible with her maxim.

As I grew older, I began to get more and more interested in the mental “loops” that us humans can sometimes get stuck in - whether related to a behaviour, a substance, or even just a pattern of thinking. I may have always a certain predilection for forming some of these loops, but I also noticed them in others, and that sometimes they can have very real - and compounding - consequences.

For mant addictions, that loop looks a little like this:

You may identify with some of these “loops” yourself. You quite possibly know many people who have been affected by them in different ways.

When I observed some of these patterns in myself, they would generally start innocently enough, but could easily cascade into something more difficult to manage. For me, one interesting example was online speed-chess. I would start playing games to relax, and then before I knew it, my brain was developing a process whereby as soon as one game finished, I started playing the next game. What's the limit for how many games of speed chess a human can play in one session? I found the answer, and here it is: _there is no limit._

I have no doubt that chess can remain a harmless, positive pastime for many people. For me, the infinite possibilities, combined with the rapid-fire succession of novel moves lead to neurochemical “perfect storm” of dopamine, adrenaline, and cortisol and more, that was capable of shifting my brain out of “positive” territory and squarely into the “unhelpful”.

As I explored means of dealing with and overcoming this and related issues, I leaned on the maxim of “moderation” in the hope that it would “guard” me from excesses, and their consequences.

- _“Your policy should be: just a few games, here and there - can’t be a bad thing, right?”_
- _“Make sure you limit your playing to 1 hour today, so you have time for other important things.”_
- _“Given that you’ve exceeded that now, 2 hours should definitely be the limit.”_
- _“And above all, never forget: Everything in moderation!”_

But in the end, my real progress began when I recognised that "Everything in Moderation" was not serving my ultimate life goals or happiness, and that parts of my nature were not always

Guidelines

Balance is what you get when you /remove/ the things that are unhelpful for you and your goals, /promote/ the things that are especially helpful, and apply /moderation/ to what’s in-between.

This definition is predicated on an idea: that some things in life are simply not helpful for us. Exactly what those things are will vary from person to person, and I think some degree of exploration will always be necessary. For me, online chess is currently in that category. For some of my friends in Berlin, that list includes alcohol - where, as the saying goes,
one drink is too many, and a thousand is not enough.

Using this principle, we can define personal “guidelines” - a clear list of activities (“and their triggers”, if necessary) that we intend to completely avoid, out of self-love, and for the sake of our own ultimate happiness and fulfilment.

After defining guidelines, my next step was to identify things that are especially /helpful/ to my goals. For me, that list currently includes spending time with friends, reading and writing, exercise, and one of my personal favourites, “completely idle time”. I call these activities “boosters”, and I find that not only does incorporating more of them into my life bring me more fulfilment, it also strengths.

In fact, enjoy thinking about /guidelines/ and /boosters/ as two “rails”, on either sides of a spectrum of our choices. You can navigate life however you please - that’s the beauty of it! - but if you take a moment to identify where those two rails are for you, and get your proverbial life-train up and onto them, you might just find that your experience of life gets smoother, and you start tracking a lot faster in the direction that you want to head!

In fact, these two ideas are core parts of the Impulse App, which you can subscribe to updates for at www.impulse.training:

“guidelines” (things to exclude because they are not helpful)
“boosters” (things to try to maximise because they /are/ especially helpful

(While it’s not the topic of this article, the third component of the Impulse app is “tactics”: the things you can do in those moments where your old patterns of thinking are triggered, and your brain /really wants/ to indulge in that unhelpful behaviour, despite your best intentions).

Now, throughout history, humans of all backgrounds and predispositions have formed their own notions of balance, and have written . By sharing mine with you, my goal is to keep the important conversation going, and perhaps encourage more of you out there to ask important questions. How we determine interesting question.
Personally I believe that exploration is normal, and natural - to find out what we enjoy, what brings us meaning. Sometimes, after that exploration, we can arrive at a place with a clear sense of , if we would only take the time to identify them.

Perhaps you might like to ask yourself two questions today:

1. Are there certain behaviours or patterns of thought in my life that are limiting my happiness? Am I prepared to acknowledge to myself that I don’t want those things in my life, instead of accomodating them with some implicit notion of “moderation” that actually may not be serving me?
2. Do I have in the front of my mind a sense of the activities that are truly “positive” for me? Would it help me to write them down again today, and try to take steps to maximise them in my life, perhaps in the pace of the things that I pledge to eliminate above?
   (Bonus question) Do I, despite my best intentions, still struggle with the urge to indulge in those unhelpful behaviours in certain moments? If so, what “tactics” could I deploy in those moments to break the cycle, regain perspective, and get back on track?

I’ll leave you with an interesting quote from Einstein on chess:

Chess grips its exponent, shackling the mind and brain so that the inner freedom and independence of even the strongest character cannot remain unaffected.

For you, chess might not belong in your guidelines, as something to avoid. But you might have a new perspective on some things that do. By taking a few moments to lay down your own clear set of rails: your “guidelines” and your “boosters”, you might find yourself tracking a whole lot faster in the direction you want to go - and enjoying the smoother ride.
