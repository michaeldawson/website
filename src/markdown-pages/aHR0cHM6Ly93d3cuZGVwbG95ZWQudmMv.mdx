## Min duration: 15 mins

## Cost to play: $0

## Background:

- With Impulse Collective, we're working with experts in software, hardware, data engineering, design and psychology, for up to a few hours a week, in exchange for equity
- We currently have 6 participants, but this will be extended to up to 25 over the coming year
- We believe that we're working to [solve some of the most important problems of our time](https://impulse.training), but we also love that people that help to make it happen are rewarded with a sense of shared ownership

## Rules of the game:

- When our friends and investor partners make recommendations of high-performing people for Impulse Collective, we keep track of the equity earned, and want to say "thank you" at seed for the recommendation
- The "thank you" depends on whether you're a friend of Impulse, or an investor
- Not all recommendations work out... And that's ok! Impulse Collective is designed for people with full time jobs, who have an interest in what we're doing - so there's not too much at stake to give it a go

## Thankyous:

1. For friends of Impulse

   We'll take a value up to 20% of the accumulated equity in cash, and find a restaurant / location that fits the budget and interests us both. We're budgeting on this amount at seed to cover the cost to enjoy a meal together (plus any travel costs if applicable) to celebrate what we achieved!

2. For our investor partners

   Every dollar of equity earned is used in our "Hidden Additional Discount Formula" to increase the SAFE discount that applies to the entire batch of our earliest (pre-seed) investors. We'll also find a way to say a personal thank you for every successful recommendation.

## What participation will look like for Engineering

In my last role as tech lead for another startup, I enjoyed setting up a few rituals, including the "daily mob drive" (mob programming for 30-60 minutes) and a pairing-first culture. Impulse Collective is highly collaborative, with themed "mobbing" collaboration sessions that members can drop in on, with solo work supported on the side if the member wants to go off and solve problems on their own. We also love that Impulse Collective is a great way to meet other high-performing, potentially values-aligned people - while solving difficult problems together.

## More about member participation

Participation is always optional, but we maintain a weekly "allowance" for each member, which represents the maximum number of hours that they can claim for a given week. The value of equity earned is based on an agreed hourly rate, and is delivered as heavily-discounted stock options that can be exercised at seed. Both Impulse and the member have the right to cancel at any time. If we cancel in the first 30 days, we reserve the right to pay cash in lieu of equity. If either party cancels after 30 days, equity rights are retained.

## Our Stack

- [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) [(Expo)](https://expo.dev)
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) and [cloud functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions)

## Who we're looking for

Our current members are in psychology, UX / branding, hardware, data analytics and React Native, but our next members should be React Native heavyweights. We're also open to other engineering guns across all parts of our stack.

## Want to play?

Do you know some high-performing React Native engineers who might like to get their hands dirty for an hour or two every week?

## Bonus question: want to join us?

If you feel like Impulse may fit the mandate of [deployed.vc](https://www.deployed.vc), it would be an honor to discuss having you [join us](https://impulse.training/join.html). However, you don't need to invest in order to make a recommendation - and we appreciate support of any kind.

## We may have some real "thankyou money" to play with

Here's the thing - we've been blown away by the quality of recommendations (e.g. [Amber](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ambersawaya) and [Simon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/simonrudduck)). We may (and indeed hope to!) grant significant equity at seed - we have budgets and mechanisms in place to support this. That means we'd love to say a big thankyou for recommendations, too.

## A restaurant I have in mind

I had a reservation [here](https://under.no) in 2020, but got turned away by police before boarding a boat in Denmark, as Covid had just hit. The restaurant was the reason for the trip, but we ended up [here](https://www.geranium.dk/en/) instead (which I can absolutely recommend, by the way!).

I've been meaning to get back to Under since.

## My question to you

Do you think that your recommendation(s) could be high-powered enough such that the 20% commission on their earned equity would cover dinner in Norway?

Michael
