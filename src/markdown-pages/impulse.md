# Impulse

There's a moment in the cycle of addiction that is particularly important, that we call the "Impulse" moment. It's the moment when a trigger leads to an internal reaction (like a craving, or the beginnings of some unwanted thoughts). It's the moment with a lot of history behind it, and a lot of amazing new possibilities ahead. It's a moment that comes back to you, again, and again.
