# Impulse

There's a moment in the cycle of addiction that is particularly important. It's the moment when trigger (an emotion, memory, smell, sound, etc) triggers a craving inside to re-live the behaviour, and the addict has to face the question: what happens now?

It's in these moments that addicts are the most vulnerable, but also stand to gain the most with an intervention. Impulse provides that intervention.

For now, if you're curious, just subscribe at https://impulse.training, and you'll be kept in the loop with new developments.
